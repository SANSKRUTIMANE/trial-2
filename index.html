      <strong>Why is health important ?</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="head2">
     <strong>
    Your health is at the center of your life. Every part of your life relies on you having good health.
  </strong>
    <br>
    <strong>
    You cannot climb higher in all the other seven areas of your life if you do not have enough physical energy to
    devote to each of them.<br> When you have low energy, it is difficult to:
    <ul>
      <li>Express love and intimacy</li>
      <li>Support your family and consciously parent your children</li>
      <li>Perform at work if you are too tired to be productive</li>
      <li>Have fun with friends if you are dull and lethargic</li>
      <li>Learn and grow if your weak body has weakened your mind</li>
    </ul>
    Have a sense of charity and contribution if ill health has you looking inwards rather than outwards on helping
    others.
    Without good health, you have nothing!

    <br><br> <strong> What Is Health And How Is It Measured?</strong> <br> <br>
  </div>
  <div class="head4">
    <strong>
    Your energy level is a reflection of your overall health and wellbeing. The more energy you have, the more you will
    get done in your day and life.<br> We all have the same amount of time in the day, so the difference between us can
    only be the energy we bring into each aspect of our life.<br>

    What most people donâ€™t realise is that there is a symbiotic relationship between your health and the other seven
    parts to your life. Your health is made up of four layers or energies:
